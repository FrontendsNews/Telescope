    <h1>What is Frontends?</h1>

    <p><strong>Frontends</strong> is all about sharing your work, receiving valuable and constructive feedback and get better at building websites.</p>

    <p>This project is similar to <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://news.layervault.com/">Designer News</a> and <a href="http://growthhackers.com/">Growth Hackers</a>, but built with <a href="http://www.telesc.pe/">Telescope</a>.</p>

    <h2>What can I post?</h2>

    <p>There are five types of posts you can do:</p>

    <h3>Feedback</h3>

    <p>Get feedback on your projects before releasing them to the world. If you want to show something finished and want to show us, use [Show FE] instead.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>"[Feedback] - My new portfolio design, what do you think?"</em></li>
      <li><em>"[Feedback] - New release of my CSS framework, give it a try!"</em></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Need Help</h3>

    <p>Hit up other developers and get a remedy for your pain.</p>

    <p>Example:</p> 
    
    <ul>
      <li><em>"[Need Help] - Getting Libsass Gulp Susy to work together"</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Show FE</h3>

    <p>Share your design with people like you and engage conversations.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>"[Show FE] - My plugin latest release, give it a try!"</em></li>
      <li><em>"[Show FE] - New blog post: How to setup Vagrant for WordPress development."</em></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Ask FE</h3>

    <p>Simply ask a question and get the advice you seek.</p>

    <p>Examples:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>"[Ask FE] - How you guys organize your Sass project folder?"</em></li>
      <li><em>"[Ask FE] - How much do you charge for a simple landing page?"</em></li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Links</h3>

    <p>Example:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>"The Truth about Web Design Trends"</em></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Simple links doesn't require any prefix, this is mostly used to share good content you find in the web that is not created by you.</p>

    <h2>Guidelines</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Be helpful and honest.</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that all experts were once beginners.</li>
      <li>All submissions and questions should relate to our industry.</li>
      <li>Not more than three categories should be selected per post.</li>
      <li>Don’t submit using all caps.</li>
      <li>If you submit a link to a video or pdf, please prefix with [video] or [pdf] to the title.</li>
      <li>Avoid to include the name of the site in the title, because the site name will be displayed after the link anyway.</li>
      <li>Here in <strong>Frontends</strong> our primary goal when commenting is to help as much as we can, if you disagree with something, comment in a way that you think it will help instead of a empty or "I know more than you" discussion.</li>
      <li>Be nice.</li>
      <li>Don’t sign comments.</li>
      <li>Don’t take things personally, disagreements happen.</li>
    </ul>
